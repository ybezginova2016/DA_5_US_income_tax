## ðŸ“Š Income Tax Analysis Project

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze income tax data from different states in the US to uncover trends and insights related to tax collection and personal consumption expenditures. The project will involve cleaning and organizing the dataset, performing calculations, and presenting the results through a dashboard.

### Data
The dataset is collected from various states in the US and consists of several Excel sheets containing:

* Total Income Taxes Collected
* Consumption Rate per State
* Locations and Tax Codes

The dataset is currently poorly structured and needs to be tidied up to improve its quality. The initial dataset is saved [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JEhog1MXnOWxJGjfDhJ0BcpvE4bxUxF0cik08UR4EqI/edit).

### Research Questions
During the research, the following questions will be answered:
* Determine the state with the highest amount of taxes per person.
* Identify the state with the third-largest amount of collected taxes.
* Name the region with the smallest sum of "Individual Income Taxes" and "Income Taxes."
* Calculate the percent changes in personal consumption expenditures between 2018 and 2020 for each state and identify the state and year with the highest change (e.g., Florida 2018/2019).
* Determine the region with the highest average Personal Consumption Expenditures per person in 2020.
