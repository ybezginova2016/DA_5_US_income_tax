### **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze income tax data from different states in the US to uncover trends and insights related to tax collection and personal consumption expenditures. The project will involve cleaning and organizing the dataset, performing calculations, and presenting the results through a dashboard.

### **Project Description**
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset that includes information on income tax collections, personal consumption rates, and other related variables across different US states. The goal is to identify key trends, compare tax policies, and evaluate how personal consumption expenditures vary by state.
